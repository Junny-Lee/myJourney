### What myJourney looks like:
MyJourney is a safe place where users can create journal entries either for themselves or others. 
The home page looks like this:

From here, the user can register or sign in if he/she already has an account. The registration page has validations (including Bcrypt).

For our purposes, let's sign in with my pre-made account.

Once logged in, the user can see their journal cover (default color is purple, but as shown later, the color can be changed in the settings):

When the list icon is clicked, the user will see all of the journal entries (posts) in one place. From this page, the user can add a new entry, search for entries by keyword(s), see which entries are important/flagged, and click into individual entries.

For example, when the user searches for "flag" in the search bar, two entries are matched.

Creating a new entry is easy. Just click on one of the "+ New Entry" buttons to be taken to this page:

Clicking into one of the entries look like this:

Back on the journal front cover page, the user can click into the settings icon, which takes the user to:

The user can click on any of the colors to choose from and the journal color will change accordingly. When red is clicked:

When gray is clicked:

Now the front of the journal looks like:
