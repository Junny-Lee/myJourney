### What myJourney looks like:
MyJourney is a safe place where users can create journal entries either for themselves or others. 
The home page looks like this:

From here, the user can register or sign in if he/she already has an account. The registration page has validations (including Bcrypt).

For our purposes, let's sign in with my pre-made account.

Once logged in, the user can see his/her journal cover (default journal color is purple, but as shown later, the color can be changed in the settings):

When the _list icon_ is clicked, the user can see all of the journal entries in one place. From this page, the user can add a new entry, search for entries by keyword(s), see which entries are important/flagged, flip between private and public, click into individual entries, and go to the _Public Board_.

For example, when the user searches for "important" in the search bar, there are two matched entries. The search matches by the title and/or text of the journal entry.

Creating a new entry is easy. Just click on one of the _+ New Entry_ buttons on certain pages to be taken to this page:

Clicking into one of the entries takes you to a page that looks like this:

Let's now go to the Public Board, where posts marked _public_ (not _private_) from any users can be seen. Here the signed in user can go back to your private space by pressing on _Personal Board_ link near the top-right hand corner. Note that the last post in this image is a public post by a different user.

Back on the home page (front of the journal), the user can click into the _settings icon_:

The user can click on any of the colors to choose from and the journal cover color will change accordingly. When red is clicked:

When gray is clicked:

Now the front of the journal accordingly looks like:
